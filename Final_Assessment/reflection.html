                In today’s world, different screen sizes can be found in pocket and on table too. Therefore, it is impossible to design a website for every screen size. This is where, responsive design comes handy. Responsive design can be defined as a set of practices that makes the web page fit in the screen ratio, resolutions by altering its layout. For example, Youtube website can be used in different devices having different screen sizes and compatibility. In other words, Responsive design is a visual user interface design strategy for creating content that adapts to different screen sizes without losing its quality. Designers use relative units (percentages) and media queries to ensure that their designs adjust to the browser space and maintain content uniformity across devices.<br>
It relates to web technology to a greater extent. Every website should be attractive and for that other than design what matters the most is whether website adapts and functions for every device. So, for that website designers use responsive web design. The main advantage of responsive design is that it ensures that you're ready for future technology, avoiding the need for a redesign every time when the device changes. Furthermore, a responsive web design makes it easier for bots to crawl a website by using a single URL rather than several versions of the same web content.<br>
Due to the lack of storage capacity on mobile devices, it is impossible for every user to install every mobile app on mobile that appears to be useful. A web app is the ideal option because it is smaller in size of a mobile app and can be accessed quickly simply typing a URL into a browser. A web app's URL can be readily bookmarked for future usage, so we don't even need to remember it. Any app's main goal is to attract users by providing high-quality content on a variety of screen sizes, therefore understanding different resolutions on different devices is critical. Because the efficacy of features varies depending on the device and the context of use, any developer must first determine how a user would use their product. Smartphones are used as desktop replacements, which is why, unlike a website that provides an immersive experience to desktop users, it's critical to build a mobile web app that concentrates on fundamental functions and activities consumers look forward to. Google's mobile website, for example, has different navigation options than its desktop page.
It becomes easy to adapt a web app to smaller and larger screens by providing a default reference design. Because the display should be appealing to the eye, we must establish guidelines for content and design adaption. Using web standards and a flexible structure for designing lets web app consumers have a pleasant experience across many devices. To create a pleasant user experience, it's also crucial to keep file sizes and load times low. It is much more convenient and efficient.<br>
Talking about this course WEB222, I have learnt a lot. Firstly, for the very first month, I learned javascript which gave me knowledge and skills how a website becomes responsive. Everything other than design depends upon javascript which is useful to fill data and search. Then after javascript, I came to know about basic structure of a website that is HTML. The full form of HTML is hypertext markup language. We can design a website as we want. Making it fully attractive and functional is the key point. For the design, I came to learn about CSS which is widely used to make website’s attractive and full of designs. CSS is important because everybody wants to do their searching fast which can only be done when site is responsive and attractive. I learnt a lot from this course and in next semester, it will make me master in web development. I find web development a way to show my creativity.<br>
